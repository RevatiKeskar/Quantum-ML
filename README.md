# Quantum-Inspired Kernel + Random Forest

This project explores quantum-inspired kernels combined with classical machine learning techniques.

## Files

### `Quantum_RF.ipynb`
- Applies a quantum-inspired feature map.
- Uses KernelPCA for dimensionality reduction.
- Trains a Random Forest classifier.
- **Result**: Accuracy is similar to traditional ML.

### `Quantum_RF2.ipynb`
- Uses a different matrix configuration for the kernel.
- Trains a Random Forest on the transformed data.
- **Result**: Accuracy is lower than traditional ML.

## Method

- Quantum-inspired kernels map data to higher-dimensional space.
- KernelPCA extracts non-linear patterns.
- Random Forest performs classification on reduced data.

## Conclusion

Quantum kernels show potential but depend heavily on configuration.
